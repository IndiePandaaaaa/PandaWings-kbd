# PandaWings Keyboard

The PandaWings is a split keyboard with 3x5 column staggered keys with two 
additional keys on each side and with 3 thumb keys, based on 
[crkbd v3](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/tree/v3-final).
Crkbd stands for Corne Keyboard.

## Idea

I wanted to create a corne compatible with the seeed xiao controller
instead of the pro-micro controllers. Due to missing pins for the matrix, 
the matrix is wired in a 4x5 grid and reshaped for thumb keys and two additional 
side keys. LEDs are permanent, toggleable with hardware switch. Per-key-RGB 
or display can be chosen while building.
